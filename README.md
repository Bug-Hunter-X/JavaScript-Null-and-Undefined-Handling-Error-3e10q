# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript when handling null and undefined values. The `foo` function attempts to access the `length` property of a variable that might be null or undefined, leading to a runtime error.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that handles null and undefined values gracefully. This example highlights the importance of robust null checks in JavaScript to prevent unexpected errors.
